1.
Generalized to handle multiple different container types
Better performance/more optimized
Well tested/bug free

2.
The _if suffix indicates an algorithm can be applied conditionally based on a predicate function
The _n suffix indicates an algorithm can applied a given number of times (vs. over a range)

3.
InputIterator
OutputIterator
ForwardIterator
BiDirectionIterator
RandomAccessIterator

4.
It's not legal to use a input iterator when a forward iterator is expected.
It is valid to use a forward iterator when an input iterator is expected

5.
back_insert_iterator is needed because we often do not know ahead of time the size of the container we may be inserting/copying in to. If it didn't exist, an output iterator may write beyond the bounds of the container it is storing values in.
